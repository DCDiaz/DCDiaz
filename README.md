- Hi, I’m Dave Diaz ( @DCDiaz ). 
- I’m interested in full-stack development, using both the LAMP stack and the MERN stack.
- I’m currently learning MERN stack development through the MIT xPro "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course.
- I’m looking to collaborate on developing meaningful Web applications to benefit the world community.
